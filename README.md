# Github-Recommender
Recommender for suggesting repositories to users on Github

Starting this project as I am getting depressed because of reasons of even I don't know why. I think programming will help me calm me and removed me of my depression. Lets hope for best. Will try to finish this project along with studies and exams in a week. 

Day 1:- 





Knowledge Gain:-
The pickle module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”, however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.

Your pkl file is, in fact, a serialized pickle file, which means it has been dumped using Python's  pickle module.

Ideas:-
1. Based on the starred repositories. I  can find similar users like me who we have also star the same repositories that I have done. (Collaborative Filtering)
