Recommender for suggesting repositories to users on Github

Day 1:- 





Knowledge Gain:-
The pickle module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”, however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.

Your pkl file is, in fact, a serialized pickle file, which means it has been dumped using Python's  pickle module.
